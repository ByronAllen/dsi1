This “little bit” depends on the certainty of your assumptions: If you have strong assumptions and are quite sure about potential outcomes, you should specify an “informative” prior which will more strongly influence the result. Strong assumptions can for example be based on strong theory, or prior data that have been collected. If however your assumptions are weak, for example because you are the first to research a topic and there are no previous data available to base assumptions on, you should specify a “non-informative” prior which will only influence the result to a negligible extent."
